# LIBRERIA LIBRE

## React proyect

In this proyect I used :
 - React native
 - Bootstrap / Bootstrap-icons
 - Formik (forms)
 - Yup  (forms validation)
 - React-router-dom (navigation)
 - lottie-react (animation)
 - react-hot-toast (notifications)


----
## Navigation
![asyncmock](/readmeFiles/navigationGif.gif)

----
## As database the proyect can use asyncMock.js. 
You just have to change the import for each method for the resource with other database.

Methods you can use:
- getBooks (get all the books in the list)
- getBookById (find and get a book by id)
- buyBooks (simulate a purchase and send an identification of the purchase)
- setBookNewStock (change the stock of each book)
